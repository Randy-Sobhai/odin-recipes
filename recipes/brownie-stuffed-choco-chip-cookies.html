    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make the brownies:</strong> Heat oven to 350°F. and line an 8×8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper, extending it up the sides to use as handles to remove from the pan later.</li>
        <li>In a medium microwaveable bowl, melt chocolate and butter together in microwave until only a couple unmelted bits remain, about 1 minute. Alternately, place chocolate and butter in a bowl over simmering water to melt. Whisk in sugar, then eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla and salt. Stir in flour just until combined. Spoon batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Bake for 20 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool at room temperature for 15 minutes, then cover pan with foil and refrigerate until completely cool, about 2-3 hours, or try making the night before and refrigerating overnight.</li>
        <li>Once cooled completely, remove from fridge and lift brownies out of the pan and onto a cutting board. Cut into approximately 1-inch x 1-inch squares. Set aside while you make the chocolate chip cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325°F.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the chocolate chip cookie dough:</strong> Whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl and set aside. In another medium bowl with an electric mixer or the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients just until blended.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chocolate chips with a spoon.</li>
        <li><strong>To prepare the cookies:</strong> take a heaping tablespoon of chocolate chip cookie dough and flatten it into a round about 3-inches in diameter. Place a piece of cut brownie and place it in the middle of the round. Make a second round of cookie dough and place over-top, pressing down the edges to encase the brownie. Place on a baking sheet. Repeat with more cookies, leaving several inches in between to allow room for spreading as they cook.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated 325F. oven until just set and the edges are just golden. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes then transferring to cooling racks to cool completely. Repeat with additional batches.</li>
    </ol>
