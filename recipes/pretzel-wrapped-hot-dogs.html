        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp white vinegar</li>
        <li>Pinch cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Pretzel dough:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cups of water, <em>luckwarm</em>(<em>about 105F</em>)</li>
        <li>2 1/4 Tsp active dry or instant yeast</li>
        <li>1 Tsp white granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 - 2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3.4 Tsp kosher sale (<em>less if using fine salt or salted butter</em>)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp unsalted butter, <em>melted and slightly cooled</em>)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>For Filling:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>8 regular weiners (<em>or 5 extra long weiners</em>)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>For Boiling:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup baking soda (<em>or boiling rolls</em>)</li>
    </ul>

<h4>For Baking:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg, <em>lightly beaten</em> (<em>for brushing before baking</em>)</li>
        <li>Pretzle, <em>Course or Kosher sale</em> (<em>for sprinkling before baking</em>)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>For the Pretzel Rolls:</strong> In a large bowl or the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, add the water, yeast and sugar. Stir and let rest 5-10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the salt and the melted butter. Mix using the dough hook or a spoon until combined well. Add additional flour in 1/4 increments until you have a smooth dough that is moist but not sticky. Remove dough to a greased bowl. Cover with a plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place for 1 hour or until doubled.</li>
        <li>Line 1 large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.</li>
        <li>Gently deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll in to a rectangle as wide in inches as the number of wieners you have (so 8-inches wide if using 8 regular wieners or 5-6 inches wide for long wieners) and two times as long as the length of your wieners. Using a sharp knife (or a pizza cutter!), working with the short edge, cut in to 1-inch strips.</li>
        <li>Take 1 wiener and wrap with a strip of dough, leaving a bit of the end of the wiener exposed. You can overlapping the dough slightly as your wrap if you like or leave space between. The wiener will cook more inside if you don't overlap, if you like a well cooked wiener or you will get just cooked and more dough if you overlap. Place on parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining wieners. Cover and let rest for 15-20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425Â° F. and place oven rack in the middle position.</li>
        <li>In a large stock pot or Dutch oven, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Slowly add the baking soda (<em>slowly, as it will bubble up a lot</em>).</li>
        <li>Place 2-3 of the pretzel rolls at a time into the water. Boil for 30-45 seconds and then carefully turn the roll over and boil for another 30-45 seconds. Remove with a slotted spoon to the same parchment lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining rolls. Once all rolls are boiled, using a pastry brush, brush each roll with the beaten egg, making sure to coat all sides completely and then sprinkle each roll with a little pretzel or coarse.salt.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, rotating pan once half way through baking. Bake until deep golden brown. Enjoy warm, with honey mustard dipping sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>For the honey mustard sauce:</strong> combine all ingredients in a small bowl and stir until smooth. Can be made ahead and refrigerated.</li>
