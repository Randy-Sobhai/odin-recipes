# odin-recipes
My first odin project!

Here is my first attempt at creating a fully working website with webpages. Keep in mind, this is the first project. So do not expect much! With that being said the website consists of a homepage with 3 pages linking to different recipes. I will try my best!

I am having a hard time with the Git adds and Git Commits. Not sure when I should be using it.
