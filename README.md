# odin-recipes
My first odin project!

Here is my first attempt at creating a fully working website with webpages. Keep in mind, this is the first project. So do not expect much! With that being said the website consists of a homepage with 3 pages linking to different recipes. I will try my best!

Added some very basic CSS code to try to add some styling to the page. 

I have trouble with when to commit and what type of messages to type out for it. Over time this should get better.
